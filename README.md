WordClock
=========

A word clock created in pygame for my raspberry pi.

This uses the screen.py class from an Adafruit tutorial and creates a word clock.  Every 5 minutes the appropriate word to describe the current time will be highlighted.  Every 3 seconds a dot is highlighted indicating the passage of time (and showing that the display & app hasn't freezed).
